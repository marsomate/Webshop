Pásztóhy&Marsó Car Shop

In this document, I would like to introduce Pásztóhy&Marsó Car Shop, an online car dealership that we created out of our shared passion for cars. Our goal was to establish a platform where everyone can find a car that suits their needs, driving style, and taste.

Upon entering the website, prospective buyers will be greeted with a wide range of vehicles to choose from. Whether you're looking for a city-friendly Suzuki Swift, a stylishly sporty Ford Focus, a dynamically youthful Audi TT, or a family-friendly or off-road compatible SUV, you'll find a car that matches your preferences. The essential details of each vehicle are displayed, including the brand, model, condition, a brief description, and, last but not least, the price.

By clicking on the price, visitors can add the car to their cart and navigate to a page displaying the contents of their cart. Here, a list of all selected cars, their basic details, and a summary of the total cost are presented. At this point, the buyer faces a decision – continue browsing or proceed to purchase the desired vehicle. Clicking on 'Continue Shopping' will take them back to the full product listing, while the 'Check Out' button directs them to the purchasing interface. If a buyer wishes to reconsider their choices, remove a product from the cart by clicking on the 'Remove' button.

The aforementioned 'Check Out' button serves as the gateway to the purchasing interface. Upon entering, the buyer is greeted with a thank-you message, as their trust is invaluable to us. The 'Go back to shopping' button leads back to the main page.

All these features are embedded in a modern, stylish, and attention-grabbing website, unlike any we have seen before. At the top of the pages, you can find the name of our site and store: Pásztóhy&Marsó Car Store. Below is a welcoming message, followed by a brief but concise description of the store. It reads as follows:
"Explore our curated selection of high-quality cars. Whether you’re looking for a stylish sedan, a powerful SUV, or a fuel-efficient hybrid, we have the perfect vehicle for you. Our commitment to quality ensures a reliable and enjoyable driving experience."
These three sentences perfectly encapsulate the essence of our store and our approach to driving.

While creating the store, we encountered various challenges, especially during the establishment and modification of the database containing car information. However, we did not let anything dampen our enthusiasm for the project.
